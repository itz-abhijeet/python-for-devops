**System Health Analysis**

The current system metrics indicate that the system is operating within normal ranges for CPU, but there are concerns about Disk space usage and Memory utilization.

*   **CPU (4.7%)**: Within normal range (< 10%). No immediate action required.
*   **Disk (25.5%)**: Above threshold (80%), indicating potential storage issues. It is recommended to monitor disk space closely and consider increasing the available disk space or implementing a disk clean-up process to prevent further growth.
*   **Memory (37.7%)**: Above threshold (80%), indicating potential memory constraints. It is recommended to increase the amount of allocated memory or implement a memory optimization strategy to prevent further degradation.

**Root Cause Hypotheses:**

1.  Insufficient storage capacity
2.  Inadequate memory allocation

**DevOps Recommendations:**

1.  **Disk Space**: Monitor disk space usage regularly and consider increasing available disk space.
    *   Consider adding more disks or upgrading existing ones to increase storage capacity.
    *   Implement a disk clean-up process (e.g., using `dd` command) to remove unnecessary files and free up space.
2.  **Memory Optimization**:
    *   Review memory usage patterns and identify areas that can be optimized.
    *   Consider increasing the amount of allocated memory or using memory-efficient applications.

**Next Steps:**

*   Monitor system metrics regularly for any changes in disk space usage and memory utilization.
*   Implement a disk clean-up process to maintain optimal storage levels.
*   Review memory allocation strategies and consider optimizing memory usage patterns.
